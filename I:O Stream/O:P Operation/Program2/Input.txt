A paragraph could be part of a text that informs people, describes something, critiques something, compares things, persuades people, lists a process, makes an argument, offers a solution or narrates a story. 
And, the level of detail will vary from text to text.
All this diversity means that it's not always easy to determine what "one topic" means when dividing your text into paragraphs. 
For example, you could have a one-topic paragraph describing Venus with the next paragraph describing Mars or a one-topic paragraph describing the colours of a sunset with the next paragraph describing its reflection in the sea.
If you're getting the sense that the word topic is a bit too grand for a measly paragraph, then think of a paragraph as a distinct section of writing that covers one aspect of your topic. 
That's the point. Sometimes, a paragraph will be an aspect of a topic, sometimes it will be a topic within an issue, sometimes it will an issue within an argument…a narrative, a process, a comparison, whatever. 
Whatever the scope of your paragraph, it should be neatly bounded as one…well, topic. If you prefer aspect instead of topic, go with that.
